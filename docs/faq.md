## Where does LeviLamina come from?

LeviLamina emerges from the depths of Minecraft Bedrock Server, sprouting forth from the seeds of the [LiteLoaderBDS](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LiteLoaderBDSv2) project.

## Why was LiteLoaderBDS renamed to LeviLamina?

Oh, it's quite a tale! You see, LiteLoaderBDS started off as a little joke, a playful experiment. But lo and behold, it grew faster than a creeper on steroids!

At first, we noticed that the name LiteLoaderBDS sounded strikingly similar to a mod launcher project in the Minecraft Java version. So, in a moment of genius, we slapped a "BDS" suffix on it to differentiate ourselves. Clever, right?

But as LiteLoaderBDS 2.0 expanded, it started bulking up like a piglet at an all-you-can-eat buffet. Its performance took a nosedive, leaving us scratching our heads.

That's when we made a bold decision to rebuild the entire project from scratch. And as we delved deeper into the revamping process, it became clear that a fresh start deserved a brand-new moniker. So, we dabbled in the ancient arts of Latin roots, preserving the beloved abbreviation `ll`, and voila! LeviLamina was born, a name befitting our magnificent creation.
